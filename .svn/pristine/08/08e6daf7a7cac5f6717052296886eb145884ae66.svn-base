  This document contains scenario's that could happen in our game. These are both textual and in Message Sequence Charts.

\section{TODO} % (fold)
\label{sec:todo}
Here are some ideas for scenario's we could make:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialisation
  \item Player 1 wins after a creature is eaten by player 2 and the last creature of player 1 is eaten. Player 2 probeert een invalid move te doen en player 1 probeert (kort na player 2) een move te doen, die verworpen is 
  \item A player tries to move a fox into the water / a dolphin onto the land
  \item During a game, one of the players leave and the other wins
  \item Een speler probeert een beest die net is opgegeten te verplaatsen.
  \item A player tries to move a fox that is to far away in the water, A player tries to move a dolphin that is on land
  \item eb en vloed
\end{enumerate}

% section todo (end)

\section{Scenario 1} % (fold)
\label{sec:scenario_1}
  A new game is started, with a board of size 23 ( 23 tiles wide and 23 heigh). Initially, there will be 7 foxes and 7 dolphins. Player 1 connects first and will control the foxes. Player 1 is informed that he controls foxes. Player 2 will control the dolphins and is informed. When both players are connected, all creatures are created on random positions (though, foxes are on the island, dolphins are in the sea) and the game is started. 
  
  
% section scenario_1 (end)

\section{Scenario 2} % (fold)
\label{sec:scenario_2}

  A fox (owned by player 1) eats a dolphin (owned by player 2). This was the last creature of player 2 and player 1 is informed he has won, player 2 is informed he has lost. Player 1 tries to move one of his foxes.

% section scenario_2 (end)

\section{Scenario 3} % (fold)
\label{sec:scenario_3}

  There has been a flood. Player 1 now has a fox in the water, Player 2 now has a dolphin in the water. Player 1 tries to move the fox. He receives an alert that he has made an invalid move. Player 2 then tries to move his dolphin and player 1 tries to move another fox, both at the same time. Player 2 has come first and first gets his error. Then players 1 move is done. (Messages are buffered and thus not lost).

% section scenario_3 (end)

\section{Scenario 4} % (fold)
\label{sec:scenario_4}
  When a player leaves or disconnects, the other player wins. Player 1 sends a disconnect message to the server. The server responds and sends a message to player 2 that he has won.
% section scenario_4 (end)

\section{Scenario 5} % (fold)
\label{sec:scenario_5}
  Player 2 eats a fox of player 1. Player 1 then tries to move the just eaten fox. The board informs the player that he has done an invalid move.
% section scenario_5 (end)

\section{Scenario 6} % (fold)
\label{sec:scenario_6}
 The board changes mode to high tide and updates the viewer. Player 1 now has a fox in the water and tries to move it. The board says he can't. Player 2 tries to move a dolphin on the dry. Now the board changes to low tide and both player's try to move the previous beasts. The dolphin tries to move onto the land and is notified he can't. The fox is still in the water, but now the land is closer by enabling him to swim.
